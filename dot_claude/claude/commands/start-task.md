# Start Task

Initiates a new development task with comprehensive planning, including workplan creation, potential pitfalls analysis, and test-driven methodology setup.

## Instructions

We are starting a new task. Before coding anything, I want you to think hard about the task and how you are gonna go about it. Scan the codebase for any potential gotchas for the solution you are approaching. Think of potential pitfalls for your approach and propose mitigations. Write about your understanding about the problem, your proposed solution, pitfalls and gotchas, into a markdown file inside the TASKS/ folder, with the filename the slugified issue ID (if provided) and description, all lowercase. Keep the plan at a high level, providing a high level overview of each script that's needed and only critical snippets at most for nuanced portions you want to convey. If given an issue ID, name the task (issue ID): (title). List out in an ## IMPLEMENTATION section each high level task, with nuanced descriptions of each task and any snippets that you deem important. For the next section of the workplan, you will add the list of subtasks for this task in a ## TASKS section, a ## LEARNINGS section which is initially empty and which you will update with insights and gotchas you find along the way,, and a new section called ## LOG which you will update every time you make progress. You will modify this workplan along the way for any changes to the architecture, update on tasks, and log of work you've done. The workplan will be the authoritative source for our current implementation and progress in this task. After I approve your workplan, give me a 2 paragraph max description of this task I can copy paste to JIRA. Give background info and implementation overview in the JIRA description. Once that's approved, we will start immediately with Test-Driven Methodology. Start with tests (either a test script, unit tests, or integration tests) that will measure your progress on this task. You will write smaller tests along the way to test any code you write. Make sure to read @README.md. Your task is:
