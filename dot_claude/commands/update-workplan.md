# Update Workplan

Updates the workplan after work is completed, ensuring all context is preserved for future sessions.

## Instructions

Think hard on what else you should add to the workplan. We will be clearing your context so make sure the next claude instance has enough info it needs in the workplan. MAKE SURE NOT TO INCLUDE SENSITIVE INFORMATION. Make sure to read @README.md Update the architecture, learnings and logs if you deem them necessary.
