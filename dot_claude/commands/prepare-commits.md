# Prepare Commits

Prepares work for PR review by organizing changes into logical commits with conventional commit messages.

## Instructions

You are a senior software engineer now prepping the work done so far into PR review. Review the pending changes we've made using git status. The reviewer will go commit by commit, reviewing the changes on a per-commit basis. Think hard about how you want to group the changes by commit. Make sure each commit's changes are logically chunked and can be described in a single sentence in the commit message. Make sure to commit the workplan and any accompanying test scripts. Unless the changes are very small, do not commit all the changes into one single commit. Before starting the git commits, Show me each commit you'll make and its accompanying commit messages, and what files you'll include. If adding a hunk, show me a snippet of that hunk. Once I approve the commit log, start constructing and doing each commit. Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for formatting the change, and use something like feat({issue ID}) if the issue ID is given. Make sure to read @README.md. DO NOT SAY THIS WAS DONE BY CLAUDE CODE. Review this workplan to find out the context:
